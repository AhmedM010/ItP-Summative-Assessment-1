## Exercise 2: Greetings :ballot_box_with_check
# Start with the list you used in Exercise 1, but instead of just
# printing each person’s name, print a message to them. 
# The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be 
# personalized with the person’s name.
names = ['Zuriel Johnfred', 'Mohammed Bahri', 'Jose Luigi']
